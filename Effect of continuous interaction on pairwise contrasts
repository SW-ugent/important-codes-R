#I have a 3-level categorical variable type interacting with a continuous variable duration (centered) in a linear model. 
#I'm using lsmeans::lsmeans to test the contrasts between different levels of type. 
#The hypothesis is that, as duration increases, the difference between the first two levels of type should grow larger. In particular, as duration increases, I expect the second level to have a larger effect on the response variable while the first level should not be sensitive to duration.
#How do I test whether the contrast between the first two levels of item changes as a function of the continuous variable?
#This is the answer I found: use 
lst = lsmeans::lstrends(mod, ~type, var="duration") 
cld(lst) 
pairs(lst)
#The lstrends approach you show compares the slopes of the duration trends for each treatment. 
#So it relates to your question but doesn't answer it directly. How about if you do
lsm = lsmeans(mod, ~ type|duration, at = list(duration = c(10,15,60)) 
#where you supply a few typical duration values. Then 
print(lsm) 
pairs(lsm)# the latter showing how the conditions compare at each duration in the at list.
